# Checkbook_Program

This program, I designed a Java program to record checking account transactions
and to keep track of the amount of money in your checking account. A transaction record should
include the following information:
. Transaction date, a string of characters
. Transaction type; Deposit, Automatic deposit, ATM Withdrawal, Check, or Debit Card.
. Check No., an integer
. Transaction description, a string of characters
. Amount, a floating point number
My program allows a user to do the following:
1. Create a new account
2. Load transactions from a file
3. Add new transactions
4. View/Delete transactions
5. Backup transactions

My program has a GUI for easy functionality.
